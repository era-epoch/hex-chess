# about this project

This is a webapp written in Typescript (React+Redux) for playing the game of hex-chess. I intend to work on this when I have the time and motivation.

# beginner's tips
- bishops stay on their own colour tiles, each side has 1 bishop for each of the three colours of tile
- knights will always move to a different coloured tile
